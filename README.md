Looking for shockwaves in a burguer's equation simulation
I'm compating the solution the command "NDSolve" in wolfram mathematica with a hard-coded Runge Kutta method in 3D.
Burgers' equation or Batemanâ€“Burgers equation is a fundamental partial differential equation occurring in various areas of applied mathematics, such as fluid mechanics, nonlinear acoustics,gas dynamics, and traffic flow. The equation was first introduced by Harry Bateman in 1915 and later studied by Johannes Martinus Burgers in 1948.

For a given field {\displaystyle u(x,t)}u(x,t) and diffusion coefficient (or kinematic viscosity, as in the original fluid mechanical context) {\displaystyle \nu }\nu , the general form of Burgers' equation (also known as viscous Burgers' equation) in one space dimension is the dissipative system:



{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}+u{\frac {\partial u}{\partial x}}=\nu {\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}}.}
