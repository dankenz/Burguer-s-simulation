# Burguer-s-simulation
Looking for shockwaves in a burguer's equation simulation
I'm comparing the solution to the command "NDSolve" in wolfram mathematica with a hard-coded Runge Kutta method in 3D.
Burgers' equation or Batemanâ€“Burgers equation is a fundamental partial differential equation occurring in various areas of applied mathematics, such as fluid mechanics, nonlinear acoustics,gas dynamics, and traffic flow. The equation was first introduced by Harry Bateman in 1915 and later studied by Johannes Martinus Burgers in 1948.

For more information about the method see: 'Numerical recipes: the art of scientific computing' third edition from william H. Press, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling and Brian P. Flannery


In the 'Solutions.rar' file you can find 2 small animations of the solutions from the NDSolve and the hard coded. If you cant open the mathematica file you can open the pdf version.
